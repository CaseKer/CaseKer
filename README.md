- 👋 Hi, I’m @CaseKer.  You can call me Case, or really whatever you want.
- 👀 I’m interested in connecting with other coders, and getting more into gemini protocol projects.  Maybe even making a friend along the way.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to function on a very basic level 😂
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on someone else's project.  Because I am not terribly creative.
- 📫 @CaseKer on most services.  (might be lying)
